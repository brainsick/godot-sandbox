# asset-import
A proof of concept for importing assets into Godot 3 from the command line.

Use by adding these files to your project's root directory and then invoke import.sh.  Makes no attempt to coordinate with other running Godot instances.

Based on discussion in [godotengine/godot#15957](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/15957).
